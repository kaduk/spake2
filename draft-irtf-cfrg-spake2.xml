      <t>This document describes SPAKE2, a means for two parties that share a password
        to derive a strong shared key with no risk of disclosing the password.
        This password-based key exchange protocol is compatible with any group
        (requiring only a scheme to map a random input of fixed length per group
        to a random group element), is
        computationally efficient, and has a security proof.
        Predetermined parameters for a selection of commonly used groups are
        also provided for use by other protocols.</t>

        when, and only when, they
        appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="definition" title="Definition of SPAKE2">
      <section title="Setup">
        <t>Let G be a group in which the Diffie-Hellman (DH) problem is hard of
          order p*h, with p a big prime and h a cofactor. We denote the
          operations in the group additively. Let H be a hash function from
          arbitrary strings to bit strings of a fixed length. Common choices
          for H are SHA256 or SHA512 <xref target="RFC6234" />.
          We assume there is a representation of
          elements of G as byte strings: common choices would be SEC1
          compressed <xref target="SEC1" /> for elliptic curve groups or big
          endian integers of a fixed (per-group) length for prime field DH.</t>

        <t>|| denotes concatenation of strings. We also let len(S) denote the
          length of a string in bytes, represented as an eight-byte little-
          endian number.</t>

        <t>We fix two elements M and N as defined in the table in this document
          for common groups, as well as a generator G of the group. G is
          specified in the document defining the group, and so we do not repeat
          it here.</t>

        <t>Let A and B be two parties. We will assume that A and B also have digital
          representations of the parties' identities such as MAC addresses or other names
          (hostnames, usernames, etc). We assume they share an integer w;
          typically w will be the hash of a user-supplied password, truncated
          and taken mod p. Protocols using this specification must define the method
          used to compute w: it may be necessary to carry out various
          forms of normalization of the password before hashing.
          <xref target="RFC8265" />
          The hashing algorithm SHOULD be designed to slow down brute-force
          attackers.</t>

        <t>We present two protocols below. Note that it is insecure to use the
          same password with both protocols; passwords MUST NOT be used for
          both SPAKE2 and SPAKE2+.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="SPAKE2">
        <t>A picks x randomly and uniformly from the integers in [0,ph)
          divisible by h, and calculates X=x*G and T=w*M+X, then transmits T to
          B.</t>

        <t>B selects y randomly and uniformly from the integers in [0,p*h),
          divisible by h and calculates Y=y*G, S=w*N+Y, then transmits S to A.</t>

        <t>Both A and B calculate a group element K. A calculates it as
          x(S-wN), while B calculates it as y(T-w*M). A knows S because it has
          received it, and likewise B knows T.</t>

        <t>This K is a shared value, but the scheme as described is not secure.
          K  MUST be combined with the values transmitted and received via a
          hash function to prevent man-in-the-middle attackers from being able
          to insert themselves into the exchange. Higher-level protocols
          SHOULD prescribe a method for incorporating a "transcript" of the exchanged
          values and endpoint identity information into the shared secret. One
          such approach would be to
          compute a K' as H(len(A) || A || len(B) || B || len(S) || S ||
          len(T) || T || len(K) || K || len(w) || w) and use K' as the key.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="SPAKE2+">
        <t>This protocol appears in <xref target="TDH" />. We
          use the same setup as for SPAKE2, except that we have two secrets, w0
          and w1. B stores L=w1*g and w0.</t>

        <t>When executing SPAKE2+, A selects x uniformly at random from the
          numbers in the range [0, p*h) divisible by h, and lets X=x*G+w0*M, then
          transmits X to B. B selects y uniformly at random from the numbers in
          [0, p*h) divisible by h, then computes Y=y*G+w0*N, and transmits it to
          Alice.</t>

        <t>A computes Z as x(Y-w0*N), and V as w1(Y-w0*N). B computes Z as y(X-
          w0*M) and V as y*L. Both share Z and V as common keys. It is essential
          that both Z and V be used in combination with the transcript to
          derive the keying material. For higher-level protocols without
          sufficient transcript hashing, let K' be
          H(len(A) || A || len(B) || B || len(X) || X || len(Y) || Y || len(Z) || Z || len(V) || V || len(w0) || w0)
          and use K' as the established key.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Table of points for common groups">
      <t>For each curve in the table below, we construct a string
      using the curve OID from <xref target="RFC5480" /> (as an ASCII
      string) or its name,
      combined with the needed constant, for instance "1.3.132.0.35
      point generation seed (M)" for P-512.  This string is turned
      into a series of blocks by hashing with SHA256, and hashing that
      output again to generate the next 32 bytes, and so on.  This
      pattern is repeated for each group and value, with the string
      modified appropriately.</t>

      <t>A byte string of length equal to that of an encoded group
      element is constructed by concatenating as many blocks as are
      required, starting from the first block, and truncating to the
      desired length.  The byte string is then formatted as required
      for the group.  In the case of Weierstrass curves, we take the
      desired length as the length for representing a compressed point
      (section 2.3.4 of <xref target="SEC1" />),
      and use the low-order bit of the first byte as the sign bit.
      In order to obtain the correct format, the value of the first
      byte is set to 0x02 or 0x03 (clearing the first six bits
      and setting the seventh bit), leaving the sign bit as it was
      in the byte string constructed by concatenating hash blocks.
      For the <xref target="RFC8032" /> curves a different procedure is used.
      For edwards448 the 57-byte input has the least-significant 7 bits of the
      last byte set to zero, and for edwards25519 the 32-byte input is
      not modified.  For both the <xref target="RFC8032" /> curves the
      (modified) input is then interpreted
      as the representation of the group element.
      If this interpretation yields a valid group element with the
      correct order (p), the (modified) byte string is the output.  Otherwise,
      the initial hash block is discarded and a new byte string constructed
      from the remaining hash blocks. The procedure of constructing a
      byte string of the appropriate length, formatting it as
      required for the curve, and checking if it is a valid point of the correct
      order, is repeated
      until a valid element is found.</t>

      <t>These bytestrings are compressed points as in <xref target="SEC1" />
        for curves from <xref target="SEC1" />.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>A security proof of SPAKE2 for prime order groups is found in <xref
          target="REF" />.  Note that the choice of M and N is critical for the
        security proof.  The generation method specified in this document is
        designed to eliminate concerns related to knowing discrete logs of M
        and N.</t>

      <t>SPAKE2+ appears in <xref target="TDH" /> along with a path to a proof that
        server compromise does not lead to password compromise under the DH assumption
        (though the corresponding model excludes precomputation attacks).</t>

      <t>There is no key-confirmation as this is a one-round protocol. It is
        expected that a protocol using this key exchange mechanism will provide key
        confirmation separately if desired.</t>

      <t>Elements received from a peer MUST be checked for group membership:
        failure to properly
        validate group elements can lead to attacks. In particular it is
        essential to verify that received points are valid compressions of
        points on an elliptic curve when using elliptic curves. It is not
        necessary to validate membership in the prime order subgroup: the
        multiplication by cofactors eliminates the potential for mebership
        in a small-order subgroup.</t>

      <t>The choices of random numbers MUST BE uniform. Note that to pick a
        random multiple of h in [0, p*h) one can pick a random integer in [0, p)
        and multiply by h. Ephemeral values MUST NOT be reused; such reuse
        permits dictionary attacks on the password.</t>

      <t>SPAKE2 does not support augmentation. As a result, the server has to
        store a password equivalent. This is considered a significant drawback,
        and so SPAKE2+ also appears in this document.</t>

      <t>As specified, the shared secret K is not suitable for direct use as a shared
        key.  It MUST be passed to a hash function along with the public values
        used to derive it and the identities of the participating parties
        in order to avoid attacks.  In
        protocols which do not perform this separately, the value denoted K'
        MUST be used instead of K.</t>
