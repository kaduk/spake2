      <t>This document describes SPAKE2, a means for two parties that share a password
        to derive a strong shared key with no risk of disclosing the password.
        This password-based key exchange protocol is compatible with any group
        (requiring only a scheme to map a random input of fixed length per group
        to a random group element), is
        computationally efficient, and has a security proof.
        Predetermined parameters for a selection of commonly used groups are
        also provided for use by other protocols.</t>

      <section title="Setup" anchor="setup">
        <t>Let G be a group in which the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH)
          problem is hard. Suppose G has order p*h where p is a large prime;
          h will be called the cofactor. Let I be the unit element in
          G, e.g., the point at infinity if G is an elliptic curve group. We denote the
          operations in the group additively. We assume there is a representation of
          elements of G as byte strings: common choices would be SEC1 <xref target="SEC1"/>
          uncompressed or compressed for elliptic curve groups or big
          endian integers of a fixed (per-group) length for prime field DH.
          We fix two elements M and N in the prime-order subgroup of G as defined
          in the table in this document for common groups, as well as a generator P
          of the (large) prime-order subgroup of G. In the case of a composite order group
	  we will work in the quotient group. P is specified in the document defining
          the group, and so we do not repeat it here.</t>

        <t>|| denotes concatenation of strings. We also let len(S) denote the
          length of a string in bytes, represented as an eight-byte little-
          endian number. Finally, let nil represent an empty string, i.e.,
          len(nil) = 0.</t>

        <t>KDF is a key-derivation function that takes as input a salt, intermediate
          keying material (IKM), info string, and derived key length L to derive a
          cryptographic key of length L. MAC is a Message
          Authentication Code algorithm that takes a secret key and
          message as input to produce an output. Let Hash be a hash function from
          arbitrary strings to bit strings of a fixed length. Common choices
          for H are SHA256 or SHA512 <xref target="RFC6234"/>. Let MHF be a memory-hard
          hash function designed to slow down brute-force attackers. Scrypt <xref target="RFC7914"/>
          is a common example of this function. The output length of MHF matches that
          of Hash. Parameter selection for MHF is out of scope for this document.
          <xref target="Ciphersuites"/> specifies variants of KDF, MAC, and Hash
          suitable for use with the protocols contained herein.</t>

        <t>Let A and B be two parties. A and B may also have digital
          representations of the parties&apos; identities such as Media Access Control addresses
          or other names (hostnames, usernames, etc). A and B may share Additional
          Authenticated Data (AAD) of length at most 2^16 - 1 bits that is separate
          from their identities which they may want to include in the protocol execution.
          One example of AAD is a list of supported protocol versions if SPAKE2(+) were
          used in a higher-level protocol which negotiates use of a particular PAKE. Including
          this list would ensure that both parties agree upon the same set of supported protocols
          and therefore prevent downgrade attacks. We also assume A and B share an integer w;
          typically w = MHF(pw) mod p, for a user-supplied password pw.
          Standards such as NIST.SP.800-56Ar3 suggest taking mod p of a
          hash value that is 64 bits longer than that needed to represent p to remove
          statistical bias introduced by the modulation. Protocols using this specification must define
          the method used to compute w: it may be necessary to carry out various
          forms of normalization of the password before hashing <xref target="RFC8265" />.
          The hashing algorithm SHOULD be a MHF so as to slow down brute-force
          attackers. </t>

      <section title="Protocol Flow" anchor="flow">
        <t>SPAKE2 is a one round protocol to establish a shared secret with an
          additional round for key confirmation. Prior to invocation, A and B are provisioned with
          information such as the input password needed to run the protocol. 
          During the first round, A sends a public share pA 
          to B, and B responds with its own public share pB. Both A and B then derive a shared secret
          used to produce encryption and authentication keys. The latter are used during the second
          round for key confirmation. (<xref target="keys"/> details the key derivation and 
          confirmation steps.) In particular, A sends a key confirmation message cA to B, and B responds
          with its own key confirmation message cB. Both parties MUST NOT consider the protocol complete
          prior to receipt and validation of these key confirmation messages.</t>

      <section title="SPAKE2" anchor="spake2">
        <t>To begin, A picks x randomly and uniformly from the integers in [0,p),
            and calculates X=x*P and T=w*M+X, then transmits pA=T to B.</t>

        <t>B selects y randomly and uniformly from the integers in [0,p), and calculates
            Y=y*P, S=w*N+Y, then transmits pB=S to A.</t>

        <t>Both A and B calculate a group element K. A calculates it
        as h*x*(S-w*N), while B calculates it as h*y*(T-w*M). A knows S
        because it has received it, and likewise B knows T. The
        multiplication by h prevents small subgroup confinement
        attacks by computing a unique value in the quotient
        group. (Any text on abstract algebra explains this notion.)</t>

        <t>K is a shared value, though it MUST NOT be used as a shared secret.
          Both A and B must derive two shared secrets from K and the protocol transcript.
          This prevents man-in-the-middle attackers from inserting themselves into
          the exchange. The transcript TT is encoded as follows:</t>

        <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
	TT = len(A) || A || len(B) || B || len(S) || S 
          || len(T) || T || len(K) || K || len(w) || w
        ]]></artwork></figure>

        <t>If an identity is absent, it is omitted from the transcript entirely. For example,
          if both A and B are absent, then TT = len(S) || S || len(T) || T || len(K) || K || len(w) || w.
          Likewise, if only A is absent, TT = len(B) || B || len(S) || S || len(T) || T || len(K) || K || len(w) || w.
          This must only be done for applications in which identities are implicit. Otherwise,
          the protocol risks Unknown Key Share attacks (discussion of Unknown Key Share attacks
          in a specific protocol is given in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-uks"/>.</t>

        <t>Upon completion of this protocol, A and B compute shared secrets Ke, KcA, and KcB as
            specified in <xref target="keys"/>. A MUST send B a key confirmation message
            so both parties agree upon these shared secrets. This confirmation message F
            is computed as a MAC over the protocol transcript TT using KcA, as follows:
            F = MAC(KcA, TT). Similarly, B MUST send A a confirmation message using a MAC
            computed equivalently except with the use of KcB. Key confirmation verification
            requires computing F and checking for equality against that which was received.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Key Schedule and Key Confirmation" anchor="keys">
        <t>The protocol transcript TT, as defined in Section <xref target="spake2"/>, is unique and secret to A and B. Both parties use TT to
            derive shared symmetric secrets Ke and Ka as Ke || Ka = Hash(TT). The length of each
            key is equal to half of the digest output, e.g., |Ke| = |Ka| = 128 bits for SHA-256.</t>

        <t>Both endpoints use Ka to derive subsequent MAC keys for key confirmation messages.
            Specifically, let KcA and KcB be the MAC keys used by A and B, respectively.
            A and B compute them as KcA || KcB = KDF(nil, Ka, "ConfirmationKeys" || AAD), where AAD
            is the associated data each given to each endpoint, or nil if none was provided.
            The length of each of KcA and KcB is equal to half of the KDF output, e.g.,
            |KcA| = |KcB| = 128 bits for HKDF(SHA256).</t>

        <t>The resulting key schedule for this protocol, given transcript TT and additional associated
            data AAD, is as follows.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>A security proof of SPAKE2 for prime order groups is found in <xref
          target="REF" />.  Note that the choice of M and N is critical for the
        security proof.  The generation method specified in this document is
        designed to eliminate concerns related to knowing discrete logs of M
        and N.</t>

       <t>Elements received from a peer MUST be checked for group
      membership: failure to properly validate group elements can lead
      to attacks. It is essential that endpoints verify received points
      are members of G.</t>

      <t>The choices of random numbers MUST BE uniform. Randomly generated values (e.g., x and y)
          MUST NOT be reused; such reuse may permit dictionary attacks on the password.</t>

      <t>SPAKE2 does not support augmentation. As a result, the server has to
        store a password equivalent. This is considered a significant drawback in
        some use cases</t>

    <section anchor="pointgen" title="Algorithm used for Point Generation">
      <t>This section describes the algorithm that was used to generate
      the points (M) and (N) in the table in <xref target="Ciphersuites"/>.</t>

      <t>For each curve in the table below, we construct a string
      using the curve OID from <xref target="RFC5480" /> (as an ASCII
      string) or its name,
      combined with the needed constant, for instance "1.3.132.0.35
      point generation seed (M)" for P-512.  This string is turned
      into a series of blocks by hashing with SHA256, and hashing that
      output again to generate the next 32 bytes, and so on.  This
      pattern is repeated for each group and value, with the string
      modified appropriately.</t>

      <t>A byte string of length equal to that of an encoded group
      element is constructed by concatenating as many blocks as are
      required, starting from the first block, and truncating to the
      desired length.  The byte string is then formatted as required
      for the group.  In the case of Weierstrass curves, we take the
      desired length as the length for representing a compressed point
      (section 2.3.4 of <xref target="SEC1" />),
      and use the low-order bit of the first byte as the sign bit.
      In order to obtain the correct format, the value of the first
      byte is set to 0x02 or 0x03 (clearing the first six bits
      and setting the seventh bit), leaving the sign bit as it was
      in the byte string constructed by concatenating hash blocks.
      For the <xref target="RFC8032" /> curves a different procedure is used.
      For edwards448 the 57-byte input has the least-significant 7 bits of the
      last byte set to zero, and for edwards25519 the 32-byte input is
      not modified.  For both the <xref target="RFC8032" /> curves the
      (modified) input is then interpreted
      as the representation of the group element.
      If this interpretation yields a valid group element with the
      correct order (p), the (modified) byte string is the output.  Otherwise,
      the initial hash block is discarded and a new byte string constructed
      from the remaining hash blocks. The procedure of constructing a
      byte string of the appropriate length, formatting it as
      required for the curve, and checking if it is a valid point of the correct
      order, is repeated
      until a valid element is found.</t>

      <t>The following python snippet generates the above points,
      assuming an elliptic curve implementation following the
      interface of Edwards25519Point.stdbase() and
      Edwards448Point.stdbase() in Appendix A of <xref target="RFC8032" />:</t>
